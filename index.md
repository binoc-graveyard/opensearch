OpenSearch
==========

OpenSearch is a plugin to let you [search from within
Thunderbird](mozillalabs.com/messaging/search-in-thunderbird/).

Version 2.0 contains a drastically updated UI, with many unnecessary and
confusing elements removed, a new favourite search engine heart, and a much
saner back end.
